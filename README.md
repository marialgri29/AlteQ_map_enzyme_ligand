# AlteQ_map_enzyme_ligand
The program calculates 3D map of outer shells of electronic density of large biomolecular non-covalently bound complexes  (e.g. enzyme-ligand, enzyme-RNA-ligand, TiO2 nanoparticle-ligand complexes) in the space near the ligand and assesses complementarity factors of  the ligand to the rest of the complex
